- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Accessibility

- TypeScript

### What I learned

This challenge taught me the finer details in creating a fully accessible form using HTML, CSS and TypeScript. The form includes the ability to navigate with keyboard, screen reader compatibility and form validation.

### Continued development

Accessibilty is an important aspect of current frontend development and an area that I look forward to continuing to learn better practices to improve as an inclusive dev.
